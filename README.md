My name is Mark Russel Mang-usan, a 22 year old Baguio kid. Currently working as a customer service representative for a BPO company.

I am fond of playing video games in my free time. And I also like going out and looking for hidden places that offer unique delicacies.

My goal for this year is to maintain my phase in learning the courses and to perform consistently at my job.

I wish to become a web developer to be able to add value to myself in hopes for looking a well paying job.
